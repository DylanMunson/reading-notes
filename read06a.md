# Read 6a: Dynamic web pages with JavaScript

## Data Types

There are 3 different data types that JavaScript distinguishes between. The first being the numeric data type which handles numbers and is usually involving counting or calculating sums. The second data type is the string data type. This data type just consists of letters and other characters and is enclosed in quotes. Strings are used when working with ny kind of text. The final data type is boolean which has 2 values, true and false. The best way to describe how this is used, is that its basically an on and off switch, which can prove to be very useful.

## Shorthands for variables

Programmers can use shorthands to create variables, which is basically just another way of going about writing the code. The first way, is when variables are declared and values assigned in the same statement. The second way is when variables are declared on the same line, then values are assigned to each. Third, you can have variables declared and values assigned on the same line. Finally, a variable is used to hold a reference to an element in the HTML page which allows you to work directly with the element stored in that variable.
