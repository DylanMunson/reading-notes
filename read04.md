# Read 4: Structure web pages with HTML

## Process and Design

Every website should have a target audience in mind. Are you trying to reach individuals or companies? Where do these individuals live? What is the size of the company? Figuring out what your target audience is, is a very crucial step in the process of creating a webpage.

## Doctype

Doctype specifies which version of HTML the webpage is using. You put the doctype at the beginning of your webpage, and the code looks a little bit different with each version. Doctype can also help render a page properly.

* HTML 5 - You would use !DOCTYPE HTML incased in <>

* HTML 4 - "!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD HTML 4.01 Transitional//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/html4/loose.dtd"" incased in <>

* Strict/Transitional XHTML - "!DOCTYPE html PUBLIC
"-//W3C//DTD XHTML 1.0 Strict//EN" "http://www.w3.org/TR/xhtml1/DTD/
xhtml1-strict.dtd"" incased in <>. Be sure to replace the words transitional/strict with the respective version.
