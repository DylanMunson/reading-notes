# Growth Mindset

I see having a growth mindset as being open to challenges and learning from them, as well as seeking discomfort in any area of your life because thats the best way to truly grow.

## Ways to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindset

- [x] Take a step back and look at the bigger picture.
- [x] Learn from criticism.
- [x] Set your goals high and be persistent.
- [x] Don't be stuck for more than 15 minutes, get help or use other resources to help solve the problem.
