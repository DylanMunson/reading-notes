# Read 8: Operators and Loops

## Comparison Operators

In JavaScript, you can evaluate a situation by comparing one value in the script to what you might expect it to be, and the result will be a Boolean: true or false. There are 8 different comparison operators, there is '==' which compares two values to see if they're the same. There is != which is not equal to and the operator compares two values to see if they are not the same. There's === which is strict equal to and its comparing two values to see if the data type and value are the same. There is also !== which is strict not equal to and its comparing to values to check that both the data type and value are not the same. There is greater than and equal to which are self explanatory, >= greater than or equal to, and <= less than or equal to.

## Loops

Loops in javascript are very handy. They check a condition and if it returns true, a code block will run. The condition will then be checked again and if it still returns true, itll run again and again until it returns false. 'for' is a common type of loop and is used when you want to run a code a specific number of times. Another common loop is while. While is what you should use when you dont know how many times you want a code to run, because it will run the code as long as the condition is true.
