## Cloning

Cloning from github is where you really get started with coding in a text editor. To clone a repository is very simple, you open terminal and use "git clone" followed by the repository's URL. If you want to clone into a specific directory, you would follow that command with the directory of choosing.

## Committing and Pushing

Committing and pushing your files back to github is how you see your changes on your live site. You would use "git commit -m" followed by a message about the changes in quotes, or "git commit -a" to commit any modification to any file in the directory. Once you commit the changes, you push them to your remote repository by using "git push origin master" and they should appear on your site.
