## What makes a computer, a computer

Computers are very complex while also being very simple if you look at the bigger picture. All computers have 4 tasks that classify them as a computer, which are the input, processing, storage, and eventually the output. The input takes information from another source, processes it, stores it, and eventually outputs it to the world.

## Binary

Binary is the code in the very back-end, which is comprised of 1's and 0's. Binary is the real driving force of how a computer works and luckily, it's not dealt with all too much anymore. The number 1 is equivalent to being on, and 0 is off. In binary, the number system works a little differently, and multiplies by 2 as you move on in the numbers positions.

## CPU

The CPU of a computer is basically the brain of the operation, and stands for Centralized Processing Unit. CPU's take information from memory when prompted, performs the task, sends it back to memory, and outputs it to a screen. To do just about anything, the CPU runs thousands and thousands of instructions almost instantly.
