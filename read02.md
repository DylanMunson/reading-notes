## Comparison of “basic” text editor vs coding-specific text editor vs IDE

There are definite key differences between a "basic" text editor, a coding specific text editor, and an IDE that can largely impact how your coding experience goes.
A basic text editor just displays text in one color, usually with a lot fewer advanced functions and a lot more basic in general.
Coding-specific text editors are typically able to do much more than a basic text editor. Often, it offers syntax highlighting, code snippets, autocompletion, more advanced navigation, etc.
An IDE can have many features, It's basically a text editor, a file manager, a compiler, and a debugger all in one. It can have just about every bell and whistle you could need, and would take a long time to master.
