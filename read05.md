# Read 5: Design web pages with CSS

## Selectors

CSS has many different selectors that let you target rules of specific elements in an HTML file. Most of the selectors are case sensitive and have to match exactly with what the elements name and attribute values are. The ones that stood out to me were the universal selector which applies to all elements, ex: " * {} " , and the type selector. The type selector matches the elements names and an example would be "h1, h2, h3 {}" and that would target those 3 elements.

## Colors

You can use the color property in CSS to specify the color of text in an element, and you can do that in 3 different ways. The first being rgb values which just says how much red, green, and blue is in a color, and would look like this color: rgb(100,100,90). The second way is using hex codes, which are 6 digit codes preceded by a pound sign and look live this #ee3e80. The final way is just by simply using the color name. There are 147 color names that are recognized by browsers.
