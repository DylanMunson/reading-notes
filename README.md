# ----------------- Dylan's Reading Notes -----------------

## Growth Mindset
I see having a growth mindset as being open to challenges and learning from them, as well as seeking discomfort in any area of your life because thats the best way to truly grow.

## Ways to Keep Yourself in a Growth Mindset
- [x] Take a step back and look at the bigger picture.
- [x] Learn from criticism.
- [x] Set your goals high and be persistent. 
- [x] Don't be stuck for more than 15 minutes, get help or use other resources to help solve the problem.
