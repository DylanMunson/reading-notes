# Read: 01 - Learning Markdown

## Headings

To have headings using the markdown syntax is very straightforward. Headings use the pound sign before the heading text in any amount of 1 - 6, and the size scales down as you use more. One "#" is the largest, and 6 is the smallest.

## Styling text

You can style text in 5 different ways, bold, italic, strikethrough, bold and nested italic, and all bold with all italic. All styled text has non-alphabetic characters before and after the specified text. For bold you use ** before and after, italic uses * , strikethrough uses ~~ , bold with nested italic is the same as bold but with _ specifying the text with italics, and all bold with all italic is *** .

Markdown is very straightforward and simple in general.
